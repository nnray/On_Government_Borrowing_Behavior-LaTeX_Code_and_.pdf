\section*{Introduction}
%Look at Dreher's book, Kidd's international formal theory book, Hernadez 2017 paper, etc.
BRI (\cite{dreher2022}), Globalization (papers from week 6)? 

Lots of academic attention on supply side provision of aid given China's entrance (e.g., \cite{dreher2018}, \cite{dreher2015}), but few explorations of the demand side after China has become a prevalent donor. Also research on how Chinese aid affects recipients in various ways (e.g., \cite{martorano2020}, \cite{bader2015}).
This paper seeks to address this shortage in the literature, aiming to understand how recipient countries choose between the vast number of credible donors. Relevant literature: \cite{kilama2016a}, \cite{hernandez2017}, \cite{li2017a}, \cite{isaksson2018}, \cite{humphrey2019}, \cite{broich2017a}.

Research Question. Given the literature, the decision-making of recipient countries no longer seems so trivial (i.e., why are countries choosing to receive aid money from China?). The literature implies that there should be a healthy mix of aid donor money given the effects shown. Some strategy is no involved on behalf of the recipient country; if we are not seeing a diversified diet in aid receipt, why not? Seems best.
